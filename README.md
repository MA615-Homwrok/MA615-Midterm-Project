# MA615-Midterm-Project
Hi, this is group 1.
This is for our midterm project on MA615(FALL 2021).

We have strawberry and pesticide csv file. After we cleaned and combined two data sets.We got a data frame which contains different chemical brand, different chemical type, toxicity-human/bee, toxicity level, state, year and measurements.

After we got the data frame, we have three questions basic on it.
- Which state plants strawberries by letting them grow up organically or using the chemicals.
_ Will a state has a preference of using a specific pesticide? And will the preference will change by years?
- Is the preference is related to the toxicity of chemicals? And the toxicity

Our steps:
- Cleaning
- Wrangling
- Questions
- EDA
- Shiny Application
- Conclusion

This is our first time to finish a whole project during such short time and we might have limitations and shortages.

Thank you!:)
